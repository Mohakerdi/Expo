## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a realistic 3D simulation of a two-story modern shopping mall and its surrounding urban environment. Developed using **Modern OpenGL**, the project demonstrates advanced computer graphics techniques including lighting, texturing, camera movement, and 3D asset integration.

The mall is designed to be life-like, featuring various commercial sectors and a detailed exterior environment including residential buildings and a public park.

### 🏢 Mall Interior
* **First Floor:** * **Electronics Store:** Featuring gadget displays.
    * **Supermarket:** Fully stocked with aisles and cashier stations.
    * **Restaurant:** Designed with dining areas.
* **Second Floor:**
    * **Bookstore (Library):** Organized shelving and reading zones.
    * **Cafe:** A cozy social spot.
    * **Furniture Gallery:** Displaying various home setups.
    * **Clothing Store:** Mannequins and apparel displays.

### 🏙️ Exterior Environment
* **Surrounding Area:** Detailed residential buildings and public streets.
* **Mall Garden:** A landscaped green zone for aesthetics.
* **Faculty of IT Engineering:** A special 3D model of our faculty building located right across from the mall.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Graphics API:** Modern OpenGL (Core Profile)
* **Language:** C++
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
* **Key Libraries:** GLFW, GLEW/GLAD, GLM.

## 🌿 Repository Structure (Branches)
The project is divided into branches to manage asset sizes and facilitate testing:

* **`main`**: Contains only the core source code and dependencies. 
    * *Visuals:* Scene appears black, only the **Skybox** is rendered.
* **`with_textures`**: Includes the code plus all surface textures (Walls, floors, signs).
* **`with_textures_and_models`**: The full project containing code, textures, and all high-poly 3D models.

## 📦 Assets & Models
While the architectural structure was built programmatically, we integrated specific 3D models to enhance the scene:
* **Nature:** Trees, plants, and a central fountain (Bahra).
* **Supermarket Assets:** Shopping carts and cashier desks.
* **Interactive Elements:** Furniture, chairs, and staircases.
* **Populations:** Animated cartoon characters.
